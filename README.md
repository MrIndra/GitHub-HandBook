# GitHub HandBook
**GitHub** is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 31 million developers.

Well I understand that sounds cranky, let’s start with a few basics, shall we?

##Terminology:
**Repository:** A repository is a folder inside which you are going to store every piece of your code.
Fork: Copying someone’s repository into your account is called forking.
Upstream: The guy or organisation which owns the code that you forked.
1. What is Git?
Version Control System (keep reading and this will make sense towards the end).
Let’s say you have a project you want to work on. 
Now you have two primary motives:
(a) To write some code
 (b) To take up the project as a team, meaning that more than one people are going to be responsible for writing the code.
So suppose you write a "Hello World!" program and then your friend/other developer decides that it should say "Hello, I am awesome" instead of the original "Hello World!".
Even for this little piece of code, you will have a copy on your PC and your friend will have one on his PC. 
Let’s say you change the code; now at this point your friend wouldn't know the changes you have made and vice versa.
This is where the Git magic comes. 
1. Git lets you save your code online.
2. Git will allow all the developers of a project to see what changes the other one has made.
3. It allows you to discuss issues in your code with other developers.
And a lot more...
