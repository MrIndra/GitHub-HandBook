# GitHub HandBook
**[GitHub](http://github.com)** is a development platform for version control and collaboration. It allows you to host and manage your projects and work together on same projects from anywhere.

Well let’s start with a few basics.
## Terminology

| Keyword | Description |
| ---| --- |
| **Repository** | **"Repo"** for shortv is a folder for storing your codes, files, text files, image files, etc. It can be local folder on your computer, or a storage space on GitHub. |
| **Fork** | A copy of someone else's project or repository. Forking makes it possible for you to freely experiment the project **WITHOUT** affecting the original project. |
| **Upstream** | The original repo or Project that you have forked |

Repositories
Branches
Commits

## [What is Git?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git)

It is basically a **Version Control System** which helps us to have a multiple versions of our project every point of time to avoid losing or overwriting it.
If you are working together on the same projects then **Git** will help you to:
- Save your codes online.
- See what new changes are made by all developers
- Discuss issues with other developers
- Recovering deleted datas
- Revert accidentally changed data.
- Share and exchange code with other developers easily.
- Backup your code easily to a remote server.
- **And Many more**

    <p align="justify">
      Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates
      Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:
story.txt
story-joe-edit.txt
story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt
Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.
