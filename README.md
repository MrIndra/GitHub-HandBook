# GitHub HandBook
**[GitHub](http://github.com)** is a development platform for version control and collaboration. It allows you to host and manage your projects and work together on same projects from anywhere.
Let’s start with a few basics.
## Terminology

| Command | Description |
| ---| --- |
| Repository | **"Repo"** for shortv is a folder for storing your codes. |
| Fork | A copy of someone else's project or repository. Forking makes it possible for you to freely experiment the project **WITHOUT** affecting the original project. |
| Upstream | The original repo or Project that you have forked |


## What is Git?
Version Control System (keep reading and this will make sense towards the end).
Let’s say you have a project you want to work on. 
Now you have two primary motives:
(a) To write some code
 (b) To take up the project as a team, meaning that more than one people are going to be responsible for writing the code.
So suppose you write a "Hello World!" program and then your friend/other developer decides that it should say "Hello, I am awesome" instead of the original "Hello World!".
Even for this little piece of code, you will have a copy on your PC and your friend will have one on his PC. 
Let’s say you change the code; now at this point your friend wouldn't know the changes you have made and vice versa.
This is where the Git magic comes. 
1. Git lets you save your code online.
2. Git will allow all the developers of a project to see what changes the other one has made.
3. It allows you to discuss issues in your code with other developers.
And a lot more...
